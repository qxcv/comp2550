# To-do list

1. Make sure that my implementation complies with the SIR formalism. This
   probably means resampling at every step, but it also means finding
   probabilistic justification for my choice of (movement-dependent) transition
   distribution.
2. Look into "leapfrog" edges between roads. A nicely curved edge to reflect the
   path of the vehicle at an intersection could make the filter more responsive
   during sharp turns.
